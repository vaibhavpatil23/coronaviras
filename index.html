        <h2> Springer Nature is committed to supporting the global response</h2>
        <p>
            The need for continued access to research and learning has never been more important. We recognise our role in this and we continue to work with global organisations, such as the World Health Organisation and the initiative from the White House Office of Science and Technology to make all relevant global research, and data, immediately available. We also continue to work directly with teachers, lecturers, librarians, students and institutions to support their work. See more from our CEO, Frank Vrancken Peeters on our response to the pandemic.

                if you have COVID-19 symptoms. A viral test tells you if you are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. If you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should get tested for COVID-19 immediately. If you have been exposed to COVID-19 and do not have symptoms, you should test 5 full days after your exposure. If you do not test at the right time, you are more likely to get an inaccurate test result.

                You may choose to get a PCR test at a testing site or healthcare facility. PCR tests are more likely to detect the virus compared to antigen tests. Rapid antigen tests provide results quickly and are available at testing sites or for use at-home. FDA recommends 2 negative antigen tests (if you have symptoms) or 3 negative antigen tests (if you do not have symptoms), performed 2 days (48 hours) apart to be confident that you do not have COVID-19.

            </h2>
            <p>
                About 14 % of COVID-19 cases are severe and 5% may require ICU support. One of the common secondary complications to COVID-19 in severe cases is ARDS.[4]

                Evidence shows that lung recruitment maneuver along with other co-intervention like higher PEEP ventilation strategy and lung protection strategy (ventilation strategies that combine low tidal volumes and relatively high respiratory rate by applying positive end expiratory pressure in relation with appropriate FiO2) has shown benefit to the patient with ARDS than recruitment maneuver alone.[1][3] Even though the significance of recruitment maneuver in ARDS patient is low, WHO has chosen recruitment maneuver as a relative intervention with high continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (30–40 cmH2O), progressive incremental increases in PEEP with constant driving pressure, or high driving under supervised monitoring of hemodynamics and considering benefit VS risk. Recruitment maneuver should be immediately discontinued if there are any signs of no improvement in oxygenation, hypotension, or barotrauma.[6] And stepwise recruitment maneuver is recommended
